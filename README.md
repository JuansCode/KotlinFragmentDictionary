# [KotlinDictionary](https://market.mashape.com/community/urban-dictionary)

Created an Android Application in Kotlin using Urban Dictionary API. Utilized MVVM architectural pattern and included a Fragment with Navigation Component.

In order to run application:
 - Have Android Studio installed
 - Install an Android Virtual Device, or have your phone configured to run on Android Studio
When application is running:

![Main Page](https://github.com/JuansCode/KotlinFragmentDictionary/blob/master/Screenshot_20200322-120857_Kotlin%20Dictionary.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")
An Edit Text with a Search Icon should be available. Insert any word you would like to search on Edit Text bar, and press the monacle icon
to perform the search.

When search is performed:
![Search word](https://github.com/JuansCode/KotlinFragmentDictionary/blob/master/Screenshot_20200322-120917_Kotlin%20Dictionary.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")
Once you hit search an Image View with Thumbs Up & Down 
should appear, with the list of items from the Api call.

When Thumps Up & Down is pressed:
![Thumbs Press](https://github.com/JuansCode/KotlinFragmentDictionary/blob/master/Screenshot_20200322-120924_Kotlin%20Dictionary.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")
Pressing the Thumbs image view should sort the list to decending order based on Thumbs Down, or Thumbs Up number


Need to implement a Working Dialog when performing a search
